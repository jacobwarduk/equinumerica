# equinumerica
### Get the indices in an array where the sum of the preceding elements is equal to the sum of the remaining elements

By it's name, you may expect this module to be epic...it's not.

However it does one thing, and it does that thing well. And that is the point!

 > Given an array of integers, returns any indices, such that `0 â‰¤ P < N` and the sum of the elements in the lower indices is equal to the sum of the elements in the higher indices.
 In the event the array has no such points, `NaN` will be returned.

## Usage
